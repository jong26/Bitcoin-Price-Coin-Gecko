# Bitcoin-Price-Coin-Gecko
This Project is made form the Application Programming Interface(API) tutorial on IBM Data Scientist Score. This used the API from Coin gecko to get the price of bitcoin. We also used pandas to create a new column converting ms units to date time. Lastly, we use Plotly to create a candle stick plot.
